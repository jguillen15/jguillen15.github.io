Hi üëã

## Overview

There is a [centralized page](https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-actions) that manages the iGEM Engineering organization GitHub Actions.


![This is how it should look like](igem_actions_1.jpg)


The idea is that the different iGEM packages(i.e. Plants, Anderson Promoters) have their own repository and within this, it will call the iGEM Actions.

Let's breakdown the code in the [action.yml](https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-actions/blob/main/action.yml) file that is in the repository. This file is in charge or running the actions when they are called from other repositories.
