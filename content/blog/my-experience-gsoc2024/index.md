Hi üëã


My experience during this Google Summer of Code 2024 has been great. 


My favorite part of participating in GSoC is the opportunity to create something valuable for the community. Contributing to open source is incredibly rewarding, especially in two fields I'm passionate about: computer science and synthetic biology. I appreciate the chance to learn and grow by receiving feedback from my mentors.

The most challenging part of participating in GSoC for me was maintaining the initial enthusiasm and discipline throughout each week. There were times when I felt stuck, but overcoming these obstacles was ultimately very rewarding.

GSoC significantly helped me improve my coding skills in several ways. I became proficient in using GitHub, gaining a deeper understanding of the platform and its tools. I also learned to use GitHub Actions, effectively implementing them in workflows. I gained experience in setting up environments and managing packages on my local machine. Additionally, I built my own website to document my journey, which enhanced my web development skills. My Python coding skills improved, and I developed a stronger ability to solve problems independently. Having never been involved in a project of this scale before, I am eager to continue working on projects like this in the future.

If anyone reading this will take part in a future GSoC, my advice would be to work on something you are passionate about. Also, try to communicate as much as possible with your mentor. Fail as fast as possible, and plan accordingly. Work hard and have fun, I promise it will be an incredible experience.

I am very grateful to my mentors, Gonzalo Vidal and Jake Beal, for their strong support and encouragement during this Google Summer of Code. I couldn't have done it without their help. They were kind, knowledgeable and supportive all along the way.

I greatly appreciate the National Resource for Network Biology(NRNB) for checking in with me in every step of the project, and also for giving me the freedom to work on the project without pressure. They also kept me updated with all the important dates of GSoC 2024.

Huge thanks to all the Google Summer of Code team for hosting and sponsoring this amazing program!!
