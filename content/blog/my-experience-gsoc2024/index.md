Hi 👋


My experience during this Google Summer of Code 2024 has been great. It has had its ups and downs. Being disciplined has been the most difficult part of it. I am very grateful to my mentors for their continued support and encouragement.

Also, many thanks to the National Resource for Network Biology(NRNB) and the Google Summer of Code team for hosting and sponsoring this project!!
