I am an enthusiast of applied mathðŸ§ , synthetic biologyðŸ§¬ and artificial intelligenceðŸ¤–. I am working this summer 2024 in the Google Summer of Code(GSoC), with a project to integrate a genetic device's complexity score calculator script into the iGEM Engineering workflow, using the Synthetic Biology Open Language(SBOL) standard. People can use directly my work by using the [iGEM Package Template](https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-package-template) repository, which is a template package that can be used to build new dstribution packages from. An example of this package in action can be found in the [Anderson Promoters Collection](https://github.com/iGEM-Engineering/iGEM-Anderson-Promoters). Please read my posts below to see a full description of the project, how to use the tool and my experience during GSoC 2024!
